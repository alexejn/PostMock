# Getting Started

Learn how to integrate Pulse.

## Overview

Pulse is a framework that provides complete access to the underlying data, and there are many ways to use it. This guide describes the basic integration steps.

## 1. Add Pulse and PulseUI Frameworks to Your App

There are two main installation options:

- Add Pulse Swift package to your project using SPM

```
https://github.com/kean/Pulse
```

- Use precompiled binary frameworks from the [latest release](https://github.com/kean/Pulse/releases)

> info: If you'd like to create binary frameworks using a specific Xcode version, consider using [swift-create-xcframework](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/swift-create-xcframework).

## 2. Integrate Pulse Framework

To start collecting logs, use [Pulse](https://kean-docs.github.io/pulse/documentation/pulse/) framework.

### 2.1. Collecting Regular Messages

To store regular log messages, use [LoggerStore](https://kean-docs.github.io/pulse/documentation/pulse/loggerstore).

```swift
LoggerStore.shared.storeMessage(
    label: "auth",
    level: .debug,
    message: "Will login user",
    metadata: ["userId": .string("uid-1")]
)
```

> info: As an alternative to using `LoggerStore` directly, you can use Pulse as a SwiftLog backend using [PersistentLogHandler](https://kean-docs.github.io/pulseloghandler/documentation/pulseloghandler/persistentloghandler) struct from [PulseLogHandler](https://kean-docs.github.io/pulseloghandler/documentation/pulseloghandler) which is a Swift package distributed separately.  This way you can have more than one logger at once.

### 2.2. Collecting Network Requests

The recommended option is to use ``URLSessionProxyDelegate`` which sits between [`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) and your actual [`URLSessionDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiondelegate).

You can enable ``URLSessionProxyDelegate`` for all `URLSession` instances created by the app by using ``URLSessionProxyDelegate/enableAutomaticRegistration(logger:)``.

```swift
// Call it anywhere in your code before instantiating a `URLSession`
URLSessionProxyDelegate.enableAutomaticRegistration()

// Instantiate `URLSession` as usual
let session = URLSession(
    configuration: .default,
    delegate: YourURLSessionDelegate(),
    delegateQueue: nil
)
```

> Important: This option works only with delegate-based sessions, which includes [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) and [Get](https://github.com/kean/Get). It will **not** work with `URLSession.shared`. For other options, see the dedicated [guide](https://kean-docs.github.io/pulse/documentation/pulse/networklogging-article).

Logs are stored persistently and the store automatically removes old messages and limits the overall size (configurable). It uses a number of space [optimizations techniques](https://kean.blog/post/pulse-2#space-savings), including fast [lzfse](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/compression/algorithm/lzfse) compression.

> Tip: To get the most out of the network logger, follow the <doc:NetworkLogging-Article> guide. For example, starting with Pulse 2.0, you can record and view [decoding errors](https://kean.blog/post/pulse-2#decoding-errors) which makes it much easier to see why decoding is failing.

## 3. Integrate PulseUI Framework

To view logs and network requests from your app, use [PulseUI](https://kean-docs.github.io/pulseui/documentation/pulseui/) framework. The framework is centered around a single screen: `ConsoleView`. On iOS, you can push it into the existing navigation stack or present it modally.

```swift
NavigationLink(destination: ConsoleView()) {
    Text("Console")
}
```

> Note: There are some additional steps required for some platforms. For more information see the PulseUI [documentation](https://kean-docs.github.io/pulseui/documentation/pulseui/).

## 4. Configure Remote Logging with Pulse Pro

In addition to the frameworks and the on-device view, Pulse also provides a separate professional macOS app called [Pulse Pro](https://kean.blog/pulse/pro) that you can use for viewing the previously shared logs or even viewing the logs from the device remotely in real-time.

To start using remote logging, there are a couple of extra setup steps:

### 4.1. Configure the App

Add the following to the app's plist file to allow it to use local networking:

```swift
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Network usage required for debugging purposes </string>
<key>NSBonjourServices</key>
<array>
  <string>_pulse._tcp</string>
</array>
```

> Note: There will be no user prompts unless you enable remote logging from settings.

### 4.2. Enable Remote Logging

Open the Pulse console from the app, go to Settings, enable "Remote Logging", and select a device running Pulse Pro to connect to.

Once the connection is established, open Pulse Pro and select the device in the sidebar. The next time you launch the app, the connection will happen automatically.
